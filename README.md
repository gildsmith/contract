## Overview

The Contract package defines the foundational interfaces and shared structural
expectations across the Gildsmith ecosystem. Inspired by Laravel Contracts, this
package provides a conceptual backbone that promotes consistency and
interoperability between independently developed components.

> Note: This package contains no implementation codeâ€”only interfaces and basic
> model definitions used as references across other packages.

### Contribution Guide

Contracts are not meant to be changed casually. Since this package informs the
architecture of many systems, all proposed changes should be discussed and
justified.

**Before submitting a pull request, open an issue describing**:

- The problem or use case.
- Why existing contracts are insufficient.
- What kind of change is proposed.
